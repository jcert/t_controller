to connect to the raspberry pi via ethernet cable on linux,
first go to the wired connection options/ipv4 and share connection
now the pi should connect ot the internet using your wifi, and will
have an IP.
check connection info for your IP as host, use it on nmap (the terminal command)
to find the RPi IP, connect via ssh using:
ssh pi@<its IP>

to find the ip of the pi you can use:
	hostname -I
	output ex: 
	192.164.10.13 10.42.0.5

the pi will be connected to one of this nets
so use the ips resulted from hostname in the nmap command
	nmap <first-3-bytes-of-IP>.0/22
	output ex: 
	Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-07-27 14:53 EDT
	Nmap scan report for 10.42.0.1
	Host is up (0.000040s latency).
	Not shown: 999 closed ports
	PORT   STATE SERVICE
	53/tcp open  domain

	Nmap scan report for 10.42.0.248
	Host is up (0.0038s latency).
	Not shown: 999 closed ports
	PORT   STATE SERVICE
	22/tcp open  ssh

	Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.31 seconds

put one of the ips you got before, change the last byte to zero, that is,
if you got 192.164.10.13, write 'nmap 192.164.10.0/22'

one of the ips is the pi, one with the ssh port open. now use that to
ssh pi@<its IP>
